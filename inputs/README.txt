Files witheld
=============

In compliance with [Terms of Use](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about), puzzle texts and
inputs are witheld from the distribution.

This causes solution directories to contain broken links to files in _input_ and _puzzles_
directories. These files have to be filled in by own *private* copies by other means.
